## Building from source

Each module of the *Spring Batch Extensions* project is hosted as independent project with its own release cycle. For the build process of individual modules we recomend using a [Maven][] build system modelled after the [Spring Batch][] project. 

Therefore, the following build instructions should generally apply for most, if not all, *Spring Batch Extensions*. In the instructions below, `mvn` is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only prerequisites are [Git][] and JDK 1.6+.

### Check out the sources

`git clone git://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch-extensions.git`

### Go into the directory of a specific module

`cd spring-batch-extensions`

`cd module-name`

### Compile and test, build all jars

`mvn clean package`

### Install the modules jars into your local Maven cache

`mvn install`

## Import sources into your IDE

### Using Eclipse / STS

When using [Spring Tool Suite] you can directly import Maven based projects:

`File -> Import -> Maven Project`

Alternatively, you can also generate the Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files) using Maven:

`mvn eclipse:eclipse`

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

`File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace`

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

    mvn idea:idea
