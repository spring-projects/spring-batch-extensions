# spring-batch-bigquery

Spring Batch extension which contains an `ItemWriter` implementation for https://cloud.google.com/bigquery[BigQuery] based on https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigquery[Java BigQuery]. It supports writing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] using https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data[load jobs].

## Configuration of `BigQueryCsvItemWriter`

Next to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/configureJob.html[configuration of Spring Batch] one needs to configure the `BigQueryCsvItemWriter`.

```javaBigQueryCsv
@Bean
BigQueryCsvItemWriter<MyDto> bigQueryCsvWriter() {
    WriteChannelConfiguration writeConfiguration = WriteChannelConfiguration
        .newBuilder(TableId.of("csv_dataset", "csv_table"))
        .setAutodetect(true)
        .setFormatOptions(FormatOptions.csv())
        .build();

    BigQueryCsvItemWriter<MyDto> writer = new BigQueryCsvItemWriterBuilder<MyDto>()
        .bigQuery(mockedBigQuery)
        .writeChannelConfig(writeConfiguration)
        .build();
}
```

Additional examples could be found in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch-extensions/blob/main/spring-batch-bigquery/src/test/java/org/springframework/batch/extensions/bigquery/writer/builder/[here].
