/**
 * Google BigQuery related functionality.
 * <p>
 * These writers use java client from Google, so we cannot control this flow fully.
 * Take into account that this writer produces {@link com.google.cloud.bigquery.JobConfiguration.Type#LOAD} {@link com.google.cloud.bigquery.Job}.
 *
 * <p>Supported formats:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>JSON</li>
 *     <li>CSV</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For example if you generate {@link com.google.cloud.bigquery.TableDataWriteChannel} and you {@link com.google.cloud.bigquery.TableDataWriteChannel#close()} it,
 * there is no guarantee that single {@link com.google.cloud.bigquery.Job} will be created.
 * <p>
 * Take into account that BigQuery has rate limits, and it is very easy to exceed those in concurrent environment.
 * <p>
 * Also, worth mentioning that you should ensure ordering of the fields in DTO that you are going to send to the BigQuery.
 * In case of CSV/JSON and Jackson consider using {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonPropertyOrder}.
